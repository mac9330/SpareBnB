It showed clear signs of wear and tear and could have used a more thorough cleaning. At $400/night, I expected a lot more, but this is the trade-off when you rent someone else's house. Karim was very responsive throughout and offered to address some of my complaints.  But most of my issues were replace and/or repair which couldn't be completed in a 2 to 3 day window. This was my first experience with Airbnb and I wasn't thrilled with it. Renting out someone's home is NOT the same as renting a room from a professionally managed hotel. An obvious point perhaps, made crystal clear during my stay. With most hotels if you're dissatisfied with your room you are either given another room or only charged for the time you stay. Not with this property given the strict rental agreement. Once you pay, you're pretty much out the money. I understood this going in, but I thought there'd be more flexibility if the place wasn't quite up to par. Just something you should be aware of before signing on the dotted line.","Great location!  During our stay, Karim put us in touch with a gentleman named Gary who was immediately responding to any questions or concerns we had.    The condo was nice & clean.   We enjoyed the perks Hilton resorts, especially the pool area.   Would definitely consider renting from Karim again.   "

The apartment is nice. Good view. It's North facing though so the amount of sun is limited. 

The Hilton is overpriced for what it is. It was busy though so maybe it just wasn't to my tastes. 

The parking is $45 per day I think in the hotel. There is a group of hotels called the North Ocean Hotels. They allow you to park in their hotels for $10 per day. You can use any of them. I paid at one and then parked at the Aqua that is just across the road. That makes staying here a little less expensive.

Usually we stay at hotels.

But I must admit that Karim's description was fair and clear. 
And the view was amazing. Just like in the pictures. No cheating. 
The balcony was a little smaller than we expected, but it did not matter.

2 times we need help. Both times the problem was solved quickly and smoothly.

The one time it was settled by one of the owners, Denise. Quickly and professionally.

Similarly, when Gary Fong should help us with a basin there virkde. And he solved it quickly and effectively. We met Gary personally - he is a trustworthy and friendly person you can trust.

And thanks for the tip to park at North Beach Hotel at half price. And we parked only 100 meters from the entrance to the Hilton.

We just got back to Denmark - and can only say that we were happy to stay 14 days in this beautiful apartment.

We recommend this apartment to anyone 
- except in the periods we would like to rent it - SMILING  :-)

Denmark","We are 5 people ( 35/45) from France and we stayed in Jon and Janice house for 3 nights but we could have stayed there forever - it was just perfect.  Facilities are wonderful, everything was clean and tip top when we arrived. The kitchen was very well equipped. The house is super spacious, beds are comfortable..
What an adorable place! This area is beautiful, and near the beach..
We will definitely be back, hope in october.. Thanks Janice !

Tropical Beach Paradise Awaits You,"Imagine being one block from the ocean in an area with one of the prettiest beaches in the United States and staying in a large, spacious room with a full kitchen and walk-in closet.  You do not have to imagine any longer. Come and stay with us. Imagine being one block from the ocean in an area with one of the prettiest beaches in the United States and staying in a large, spacious room with a full kitchen and walk-in closet. You do not have to imagine any longer. Come and stay at the beautiful Ocean Pearl Motel, where you will be treated not like a guest, but as a friend. We are located in Deerfield Beach, which is one mile South of Boca Raton and 15 minutes North of Fort Lauderdale Airport. We are pet friendly and also offer monthly rates. ",26.30647,-80.07824,4,1,1,2,$119.00 ,"If your gong to stay in Fort Lauderdale, this is the only place you need to look at! Nothing short of fabulous. Right on the beach with spectacular views of both beach and intercoastal waterways, this apartment has it all. Lovely large balcony to enjoy the sunrise while having breakfast, or an evening drink to enjoy the sunset at the end of the day. Small kitchen that has everything you need to cut costs of eating out, large living, bedrooms and bathrooms. Can easily accommodate a family of four, or six if you don't mind a bit of a squeeze. The hotel staff at the pool, reception and valet were to notch and made our stay most enjoyable. Only one mile from Galleria Mall which has many restaurants and a food court, and across the street from that is a local Publix. Morning coffee is free from the breakfast restaurant on the sixth floor!! Allow an additional $35 a day for valet parking, a bit pricy, but honestly the most convenient for the duration of our stay. We look forward to staying again in the future when we will be in town visiting family. Karim provided all necessary information to make sure our stay was an absolute pleasure.","Hello Karim,thanks for you place it was fantastic.hope to come back again.","We spent 3 days at Jon & Janice's place with our three teenage boys during the 2nd week of March 2013. We didn't get to meet Janice who did all the correspondence, but the check in was easy and we appreciated her quick response whenever needed. Janiceâ€šÃ„Ã²s place was just as shown on the pictures. Well equipped, convenient and clean. The only inconvenience (especially for our three teenage boys) to be worth mentioned was the missing internet access. The house is located near the intercoastal, so Sawgrass Mills Malls, Miami Beach and not to forget Miami Airport were within easy reach. We had a nice stay, thank you!
